# Dog Image Generation using GANs and DCGANs

This project focuses on generating realistic images of dogs using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs).

## Project Overview

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) consist of two neural networks: a generator and a discriminator. The generator creates images, while the discriminator evaluates them, distinguishing between real and generated images. The goal is to train the GAN so that the generated images become indistinguishable from real dog images. This project compares a basic GAN model with a DCGAN model to generate realistic dog images.

## Features

- **Basic GAN**: A simple GAN model with fully connected layers.
- **DCGAN**: An advanced GAN model with convolutional layers to generate more detailed and high-quality images.
- **Comparison**: Evaluation of both models to compare the quality of generated images.
